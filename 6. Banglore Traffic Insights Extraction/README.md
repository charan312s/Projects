        <h1>Traffic Data Clustering and Advisory System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Traffic Data Clustering and Advisory System is designed to analyze and categorize traffic data using clustering algorithms. The primary goal is to generate actionable advisories based on traffic congestion, environmental impact, and other relevant metrics. The system employs K-means clustering to group data into clusters, which are then analyzed to provide insights and recommendations for traffic management and travel planning.</p>
<p>Key components of the system include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clustering Analysis:</strong> Utilizes K-means clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction to categorize traffic data.</li>
    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Generates visual representations of clustering results to facilitate understanding of traffic patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Rule-Based Inference:</strong> Creates advisories based on metrics such as congestion levels, incident rates, and environmental impact.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Clone the repository:</li>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git</code></pre>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
    <pre><code>cd 6. Banglore Traffic Insights Extraction</code></pre>
    <li>Install the required Python packages:</li>
    <pre><code>pip install numpy</code></pre>
    <pre><code>pip install pandas</code></pre>
    <pre><code>pip install matplotlib</code></pre>
    <pre><code>pip install scatterplot</code></pre>
    <pre><code>pip install plotly</code></pre>
</ul>

<<h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
      Follow these steps to perform the analysis:
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>Load and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for analysis.</li>
      <li>Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand the data distribution.</li>
      <li>Generate visualizations such as Heat maps, bar graphs, scatter plot, box plot etc..</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
      This project provides insights into banglore traffic trends by analyzing the data. By applying various data analysis techniques, we aim to better understand user behavior and optimize traffic.

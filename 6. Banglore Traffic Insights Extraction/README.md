        <h1>Traffic Data Clustering and Advisory System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Traffic Data Clustering and Advisory System is designed to analyze and categorize traffic data using clustering algorithms. The primary goal is to generate actionable advisories based on traffic congestion, environmental impact, and other relevant metrics. The system employs K-means clustering to group data into clusters, which are then analyzed to provide insights and recommendations for traffic management and travel planning.</p>
<p>Key components of the system include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clustering Analysis:</strong> Utilizes K-means clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction to categorize traffic data.</li>
    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Generates visual representations of clustering results to facilitate understanding of traffic patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Rule-Based Inference:</strong> Creates advisories based on metrics such as congestion levels, incident rates, and environmental impact.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Clone the repository:</li>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git</code></pre>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
    <pre><code>cd your-repo-name</code></pre>
    <li>Install the required Python packages:</li>
    <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To run the clustering analysis and generate advisories, execute the following script:</p>
<pre><code>python clustering_analysis.py</code></pre>
<p>The script will perform clustering, visualize the results, and generate advisories based on aggregated traffic data.</p>

<h2>Clustering Analysis</h2>
<p>The project uses K-means clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction. The number of clusters is determined based on the optimal value of <code>k</code>. Clusters are visualized and analyzed to provide insights into traffic conditions.</p>

<h3>Example Visualization</h3>
<p>The clustering results are visualized using a scatter plot with PCA components, colored by cluster labels.</p>

<h2>Rule-Based Inference</h2>
<p>Advisories are generated based on various metrics, including congestion levels, incident rates, environmental impact, average speed, and weather conditions. The advisories provide recommendations for traffic management and travel planning.</p>

<h3>Example Advisory</h3>
<p>For a specific area, an advisory might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Moderate Congestion: Expect delays, consider alternate routes. | High Incident Rate: Increased likelihood of delays due to incidents. | Low Environmental Impact: Air quality is within acceptable limits. | High Speed: Traffic is moving smoothly. | Normal Travel Time Index: Travel times are as expected. | Clear Weather: No adverse weather conditions reported.</code></pre>

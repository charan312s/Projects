        <h1>UK Accident Data Analysis</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
      This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of road accidents in the UK, focusing on various aspects of accident severity, casualties, and environmental conditions. The dataset comprises over 1.5 million records, capturing detailed information about each accident, including the severity, number of vehicles involved, casualties, and weather conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Exploration:</strong> Understand the structure and content of the dataset by examining the attributes and handling missing values.</li>
      <li><strong>Casualty Analysis:</strong> Analyze the number of casualties based on the day of the week to identify patterns or trends in accident occurrences. This includes summarizing and visualizing casualty counts to determine which days are most prone to accidents.</li>
      <li><strong>Speed Limit Analysis:</strong> Investigate the impact of speed limits on accidents by examining the maximum and minimum speed limits associated with accidents on different days of the week. This involves comparing speed limits to casualty counts to identify potential correlations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Insights</h2>
  <p>
      <strong>Casualty Trends:</strong> The analysis reveals trends in the number of casualties across different days of the week, highlighting the days with the highest and lowest accident rates.
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>Speed Limit Analysis:</strong> By comparing speed limits with casualty counts, the project identifies how varying speed limits may influence the severity of accidents.
